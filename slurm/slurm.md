### Background

The data in the paper was generated via these scripts written in [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) 
and sent to a supercomputer.

The data consists of:
1. `series`: the benchmark of the CTMC against the series representation
2. `credit`: the benchmark  of the CTMC against the closed-form formula by Garreau-Kercheval for a First-to-Default CDS
3. `mlmc`: the Multilevel data for the one-dimensional case, the Lévy copula case and the Lévy-driven SDE case
