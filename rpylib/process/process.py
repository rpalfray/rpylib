"""Defines the simulated process for a LÃ©vy model

The natural case is to simulate a model from its definition, that is by simulating its underlying variables;
nevertheless, this is generally not possible.
One can also approximate the jump part by a discrete Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and simulate this chain via
Monte-Carlo methods.
