## Scope

This Python pricing library was developed as a companion code for the paper:  
**_"A weak Multilevel Monte-Carlo scheme for multidimensional Levy-type processes"_** 
([**link to the paper to be added later**](https://www.google.com)).
 
The results consist of the numerical analysis of:
- the benchmark of the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) scheme approximation against the series representation<sup>[1]</sup>
- the benchmark of the CTMC scheme against the closed-form formula for First-to-Default CDS<sup>[2]</sup>
- the weak and strong convergence of the multilevel CTMC scheme as well as the convergence rate of the cost w.r.t 
the _rmse_ compared to the standard Monte-Carlo; these results mimic those of Giles<sup>[3,4,5]</sup> for diffusion processes
The different convergence rates considered in our case are dependent on the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the underlying 
Levy process.


## Results

The results are presented in the form of 4 graphs (as in Giles<sup>[3,4,5]</sup>):    
- _log<sub>2</sub>(variance)_ in function of the level _l_
- _log<sub>2</sub>|mean|_ in function of the level _l_
- _N<sub>l</sub>_ (optimal number of Monte-Carlo paths for the level _l_) in function of the level _l_
- the total costs of the multilevel Monte-Carlo and the standard Monte-Carlo in function of the _rmse_ (root mean square error)


## Scripts

#### For the paper:
The scripts used to generate the results can be found in _rpylib/scripts/benchmark/_ : 
 1. `cds.py`
 2. `first_to_default.py`
 3. `series_representation.py`

_rpylib/scripts/mlmc/convergence_ :     

 4. `mlmc_convergence_1d.py`  
 5. `mlmc_convergence_copulas.py`        
 6. `mlmc_convergence_sde.py`      

and _rpylib/scripts/mlmc/applied_ :     

 7. `mlmc_applied_1d.py`      
 8. `mlmc_applied_copulas.py`     
 9. `mlmc_applied_sde.py`     

### Other scripts:

Other scripts are available in _rpylib/scripts/statistics_. These scripts allow to plot the distribution of the spot 
underlying of the Levy process simulated by Monte-Carlo (either directly from the SDE or from the CTMC scheme).
