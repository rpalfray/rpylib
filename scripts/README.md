# Background

The scripts in this folder illustrate the use of this library which was originally developed as a companion code of 
the paper **_"A weak Multilevel Monte-Carlo scheme for multidimensional Levy-type processes"_** 
([**link to the paper - TO BE ADDED LATER**](www.google.com)) but the library itself aims to be generic and the 
implementation strives to keep concepts as orthogonal as possible, hence giving the opportunity to external users 
to easily integrate their own features (pricing models, engines, approximation schemes, etc).

## benchmark
Benchmark of the CTMC against the series representation (`series_representation.py`) and the closed-form formulas for a 
single-name CDS as well as a first-to-default CDS given by the modelling framework of Garreau and Kercheval.

## mlmc:
Generation of data to check the MLMC algorithm with regard to the weak and strong convergence rates. 
The `application` folder contains examples of the MLMC applied to a CGMY process, a 3d LÃ©vy copula and a 
2d Levy-driven SDE.

## statistics:
### Direct Simulation
> `direct.py`:
illustrates the Monte-Carlo statistics when the model can be simulated directly via Monte-Carlo; the example
at hand prices a call option with the Kou model and compare the result to the theoretical price.
